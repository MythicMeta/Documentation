# Tip of the Week

This page and its sub-pages are dedicated to providing helpful tips and tricks for both normal and power users of Mythic. There are many features that Mythic provides, and it's often hard to highlight them all in easy ways, so this series hopefully will make those more apparent. The tips will be spread across the user interface, scripting, and development.&#x20;
