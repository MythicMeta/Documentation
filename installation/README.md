# Installation

## Get the code

Pull the code from the official GitHub repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This is made to work with docker and docker-compose, so they both need to be installed. If docker is not installed on your machine, you can use the `./install_docker.sh` script to install it for you. Currently only Ubuntu, Debian and Kali are supported. {% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Mythic must be installed on Linux. While macOS supports Docker and Docker-Compose, macOS doesn't handle the shared host networking that Mythic relies on for C2 containers. You can still access the Browser interface from any OS, but the Mythic instance must be installed on Linux
{% endhint %}

### Configure your installation

Mythic configuration is all done via `Mythic/.env`, which means for your configuration you can either add/edit values there or add them to your environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mythic/.env doesn't exist by default. You can either let Mythic create it for you when you run `sudo ./mythic-cli start` for the first time or you can create it ahead of time with just the variables you want to configure.
{% endhint %}

If you need to run `mythic-cli` as root for Docker and you set your environment variables as a user, be sure to run `sudo -E ./mythic-cli` so that your environment variables are carried over into your sudo call. The following are the default values that Mythic will generate on first execution of `sudo ./mythic-cli mythic start` unless overridden:

```python
ALLOWED_IP_BLOCKS="0.0.0.0/0"

```

A few important notes here:

* `MYTHIC_SERVER_PORT` will be the port opened on the server where you're running Mythic. The `NGINX_PORT` is the one that's opened by Nginx and acts as a reverse proxy to all other services. The `NGINX_PORT` is the one you'll connect to for your web user interface and should be the only port you need to expose externally (unless you prefer to SSH port forward your web UI port).
* The `allowed_ip_blocks` allow you to restrict access to the `login` page of Mythic. This should be set as a series of netblocks with **NO** host bits set - i.e. `127.0.0.0/16,192.168.10.0/24,10.0.0.0/8`
* `excluded_c2_profiles` and `excluded_payload_types` allows you to exclude certain docker containers from starting. This is helpful if you know you're not going to use certain payload types or c2 profiles and want to cut down on time/space requirements. These are both just a comma-separated series of agent/c2 names like: `apfell,atlas` or `http,dynamichttp`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The above configuration does _NOT_ affect the port or SSL information related to your agents or callback information. It's strictly for your operator web UI.
{% endhint %}

When the `mythic_server` container starts for the first time, it goes through an initialization step where it uses the password and username from `Mythic/.env` to create the `mythic_admin_user` user. Once the database exists, the `mythic_server` container no longer uses that value.

You'll notice that a lot of the containers have a `*_BIND_LOCALHOST_ONLY` environment variable associated with them. To help prevent Mythic from opening up port unnecessarily, Mythic binds as many containers as possible to the `mythic_default` Docker network and binds exposed ports to `127.0.0.1`. If you set the `*_BINDLOCALHOSTONLY` environment variable to `false` then Mythic will bind that port to `0.0.0.0` instead. The only container that isn't bound to localhost by default is `nginx` so that you can access that web user interface without having to do a port forward to reach it.

### mythic-cli

The `mythic-cli` binary is used to start/stop/configure/install components of Mythic. You can see the help menu at any time with `mythic-cli -h`, `mythic-cli --help` or `mythic-cli help`.

### Installing Agents / C2 Profiles

By default, Mythic does not come with any Payload Types (agents) or C2 Profiles. This is for a variety of reasons, but one of the big ones being time/space requirements - all Payload Types and C2 Profiles have their own Docker containers, and as such, collectively they could eat up a lot of space on disk. Additionally, having them split out into separate repositories makes it much easier to keep them updated.

Available Mythic Agents can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/MythicAgents](https://github.com/MythicAgents)

Available Mythic C2 Profiles can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles](https://github.com/MythicC2Profiles)

To install a Payload Type or C2 Profile, use the `mythic-cli` binary with:

```
sudo ./mythic-cli install github <url>
```

If you have an agent already installed, but want to update it, you can do the same command again. If you supply a `-f` at the end, then Mythic will automatically overwrite the current version that's installed, otherwise you'll be prompted for each piece.

{% hint style="info" %}
You won't be able to create any payloads within Mythic until you have at least one Agent and a matching C2 Profile installed
{% endhint %}

### Logging

If you're wanting to enable SIEM-based logging, set the `siem_log_name` to anything but an empty string. Mythic will create that file if it doesn't exist, and log to that file. The following things are logged currently:

```
file_upload (file staged on mythic as part of tasking with the intent to get sent to the agent)
file_manual_upload (file staged on mythic as part of a user manually hosting it)
file_screenshot (file is a screenshot from the agent)
file_download (file is downloaded from agent to mythic)
artifact_new (new artifact created - think IOC)
eventlog_new (new eventlog message)
eventlog_modified (eventlog was modified, like resolving an issue or changing their message)
payload_new (new payload created)
task_mitre_attack (a task was associated with a new mitre attack technique)
task_new (a new task was created)
task_completed (a task completed)
task_comment (somebody added/removed/edited a comment on a task)
credential_new (a new credential was added to the store)
credential_modified (a credential was modified)
response_new (a new response for the user to see)
keylog_new (a new keylog entry)
callback_new (new callback registered)
```

Mythic does SIEM-based logging as JSON data where each entry is as follows:

`{"timestamp": "UTC Timestring", "mythic_object": "one of the values from above", "message": JSON of the actual message in question}`

To start Mythic, simply run `sudo ./mythic-cli mythic start`.

### Start Mythic

If you came here right from the previous section, your Mythic instance should already be up and running. Check out the next section to confirm that's the case. If at any time you wish to stop Mythic, simply run `sudo ./mythic-cli stop` and if you want to start it again run `sudo ./mythic-cli start`. If Mythic is currently running and you need to make a change, you can run `sudo ./mythic-cli restart` again without any issue, that command will automatically stop things and then restart them.

The default username is `mythic_admin`, but that user's password is randomly generated when Mythic is started for the first time. You can find this random value in the `Mythic/.env` file. Once Mythic has started at least once, this value is no longer needed, so you can edit or remove this entry from the `Mythic/.env` file.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mythic starts with NO C2 Profiles or Agents pre-installed. Due to size issues and the growing number of agents, this isn't feasible. Instead. use the `./mythic-cli install github <url> [branch] [-f]` command to install an agent from a GitHub (or GitLab) repository.
{% endhint %}

### Troubleshooting installation and connection

If something seems off, here's a few places to check:

* Run `sudo ./mythic-cli status` to give a status update on all of the docker containers. They should all be up and running. If one is exited or has only been up for less than 30 seconds, that container might be your issue. The status command gives a lot of information about what services are running, on which ports, and if they're externally accessible or not.
  * Your output will be similar to the following. Notice how the `mythic_server` docker container shows a status of `Exited`? That looks like an issue

```

[*] RabbitMQ is currently listening on localhost. If you have a remote PayloadType or C2Profile, they will be unable to connect
    Use 'sudo ./mythic-cli config set rabbitmq_bind_localhost_only false' and restart mythic ('sudo ./mythic-cli mythic start') to change this
[*] If you are using a remote PayloadType or C2Profile, they will need certain environment variables to properly connect to Mythic.
    Use 'sudo ./mythic-cli payload config' or 'sudo ./mythic-cli c2 config' for easy-to-use configs for these services.

```

* To check the logs of any container, run `sudo ./mythic-cli logs [container_name]`. For example, to see the output of our stopped container, run `sudo ./mythic-cli logs mythic_server`. This will help track down if the last thing that happened was an error of some kind.
* If all of that looks ok, but something still seems off, it's time to check the browser.
  * If you're seeing "Session Expired, Please Refresh", "Socket errored, please refresh", or "Socket closed, please refresh", then there's an issue with your websocket connections.
  * First open up the developer tools for your browser and see if there are any errors that might indicate what's wrong. If there's no error though, check the network tab to see if there are any 404 errors.
  * If that's not the case, make sure you've selected a current operation (more on this in the Quick Usage section). Mythic uses websockets that pull information about your current operation to provide data. If you're not currently in an active operation (indicated at the top of your screen in big letters), then Mythic cannot provide you any data.

## Container Sizes

Mythic starts every service (web server, database, each payload type, each C2 profile, rabbitmq, documentation) in its own Docker container. As much as possible, these containers leverage common image bases to reduce size, but due to the nature of so many components, there's going to be a decent footprint. For consideration, here's the Docker footprint for a fresh install of Mythic:

```
its-a-feature@ubuntu:$ sudo docker system df

If you want to save space or if you know you're not going to be using a specific container, add that C2 profile or Payload Type name to the appropriate `exclude` list in the `config.json` specified above. That indicates to Mythic to not even build or start that container.
