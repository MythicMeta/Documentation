# Artifacts

## What is it?

Artifacts track potential indicators of compromise and other notable events occurring throughout an operation.

## Where is it?

A list of all current artifacts can be found by clicking the fingerprint icon at the top of Mythic.

## How to use it?

This page tracks all of the artifacts automatically created by executing tasks. This should provide a good idea for both defenders and red teamers about the artifacts left behind during an operation and should help with deconfliction requests.

### When is it updated?

Artifacts are created in a few different ways:

1. A command's tasking automatically creates an artifact.
2. An agent reports back a new artifact in an ad-hoc fashion
