# 4. Submitting Responses

## Message Request

The contents of the JSON message from the agent to Mythic when posting tasking responses is as follows:

```
Base64( CallbackUUID + JSON(
{
	"action": "post_response",
	"responses": [
		{
			"task_id": "uuid of task",
			... response message (see below)
		},
		{
			"task_id": "uuid of task",
			... response message (see below)
		}
	], //if we were passing messages on behalf of other agents
	"delegates": [
		{"message": agentMessage, "c2_profile": "ProfileName", "uuid": "uuid here"},
		{"message": agentMessage, "c2_profile": "ProfileName", "uuid": "uuid here"}
		]
}
)
)
```

There are two things to note here:

* `responses` - This parameter is a list of all the responses for each tasking.
  * For each element in the responses array, we have a dictionary of information about the response. We also have a `task_id` field to indicate which task this response is for. After that though, comes the actual response output from the task.
    * If you don't want to hook a certain feature (like sending keystrokes, downloading files, creating artifacts, etc), but just want to return output to the user, the response section can be as simple as:\
      `{"task_id": "uuid of task", "user_output": "output of task here"}`
  * Each response style is described in [Hooking Features](../../../hooking-features/). The format described in each of the Hooking features sections replaces the `... response message` piece above
    * To continue adding to that JSON response, you can indicate that a command is finished by adding `"completed": true` or indicate that there was an error with `"status": "error"`.
* `delegates` - This parameter is not required, but allows for an agent to forward on messages from other callbacks. This is the peer-to-peer scenario where inner messages are passed externally by the egress point. Each of these messages is a self-contained "[Agent Message](agent-message-format.md)".

## Message Response

Mythic responds with the following message format for post\_response requests:

```
Base64( CallbackUUID + JSON(
{
	"action": "post_response",
	"responses": [
		{
			"task_id": UUID,
			"status": "success" or "error",
			"error": 'error message if it exists'
		}
	],
	//if we were passing messages on behalf of other agents
	"delegates": [
		{"message": agentMessage, "c2_profile": "ProfileName", "uuid": "uuid here"},
		{"message": agentMessage, "c2_profile": "ProfileName", "uuid": "uuid here"}
		]
}
)
)
```

There are two things to note here:

* `responses` - This parameter is always a list and contains a success or error + error message for each task that was responded to.
* `delegates` - This parameter contains any responses for the messages that came through in the first message
