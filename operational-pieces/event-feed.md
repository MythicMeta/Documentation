# Event Feed

## What is it?

The event feed is a live feed of all events happening within Mythic. This is where Mythic records messages for new callbacks, payload creations, users signing in/out, etc

## Where is it?

The event feed is located at the alarm bell icon in the top right.

## What does it do?

The event feed is a running list of all that's going on within an operation. If Mythic has an error, these will be recorded in the event log with a red background and a button to allow "resolution" of the problem. If you resolve the problem, then the background will change to green. You can also delete messages as needed:
