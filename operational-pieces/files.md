# Files

## Where is it?

All uploads and downloads for an operation can be tracked via the clip icon or the search icon at the top.

## How does it work?

This page simply shows all uploads and downloads tracked by Mythic and breaks them up by task.

From here, you can see who download or uploaded a file, when it happened, and where it went to or came from. Clicking the download button will download the file to the user's machine.

If you want to download multiple files at once from the `Downloads` section, click the toggle for all the files you want and select the `Zip & Download selected` button at the top right to download them. You can also preview the first 512KB of a file either as a string or as a hex xxd formatted view. This makes it easier to browse downloaded files without having to actually download them and open them up in a new tool.

### Additional Info

Each file has additional information such as the SHA1 and MD5 of each file that can be viewed by clicking the blue info icon. If there's a comment on the task associated with the file upload or download, that comment will be visible here as well.
